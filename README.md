0.2.0 version: Added file extension filter

This program was created to detect and delete unnecessary files on your computer that you've unknowingly created, copied, or backed up in some way.

This program was created with python3+pyqt5 and is presented to you. I originally created the program for myself, but GNU also recommends "share it with your neighbor."

This is a file deletion program and requires careful use. Additionally:

The program is still in beta and has some known issues.

FEATURES:

-Select/remove folders to scan.

-Sufficient and Ideal comparison options:

-Based on MD5 calculation

-Based on file name

-Based on file extension

-Displays multiple files in color-coded groups, and you decide which ones to delete.

-Excludes empty and unimportant files. (Uncheck the box for files like thumbs.db)

-Excludes sensitive system folders and files. (Don't touch these settings.)

-Extension filters (added on 0.2 version)

-Built-in two language options: EN (default), TR

-Adapts to your system's Light/Dark theme and any installed themes.

-Never deletes files all at once; it sends them to the trash. If you're using an external drive, it creates a .Trash.1000 file if it hasn't been created yet and sends it to the drive. You can recover your files if you regret it.

You can volunteer to use or test the program.
